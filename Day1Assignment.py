a)
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
Ans:Time Complexity:- O(N)
       Space Complexity:-O(3) or O(C) 

b)
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}
Ans:Time Complexity:- O(M)
       Space Complexity:-O(3) or O(C)

What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
Ans:b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
